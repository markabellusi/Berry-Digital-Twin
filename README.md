# Berry-Digital-Twin

Overview

Welcome to the Berry Digital Twin project! This software project aims to provide a realistic simulation, or digital twin, of a Berry molding assembly line. By using this digital twin, users can gain insights into the behavior and performance of a Berry molding assembly process without the need for physical hardware.

Features

Realistic Simulation: The digital twin aims to emulate the operation of a Berry molding assembly line, allowing users to interact with a virtual representation of the equipment.

Visualization: The project lacks graphical visualizations of the molding process, the user will follow the machines operations via the terminal/console.


Before running the Berry Digital Twin, ensure you have the following software installed:

Visual Studio Code with C# extension

Getting Started

Clone the repository to your desired working location:
Visit https://github.com/markabellusi/Berry-Digital-Twin and copy the repository
git clone
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:
Open the main simulation file Program.cs
Run the project
Install any required extensions prompted by Visual Studio Code.

Once the simulation is running, observe the terminal/console output to gain insights into the molding process.

Issues:

Currently the program is difficult to run using Visual Studio IDE. We highly recommend Visual Studio Code because all C# libraries are up to date through the C# extension. The current team has run into issues with testing this program on Visual Studio IDE not recognizing the Using Directives or classes while using multithreading. We encourage future developers to get this issue resolved as it may be fixed with future updates to Visual Studio from Microsoft. 

Acknowledgments

The Berry Digital Twin project is built upon the contributions of many open-source libraries and tools. The current team for this project consists of Senior Developers/Engineers Brain Martin, Mark Abell, Gabriel Barker, and team lead Kyle Toomey.
